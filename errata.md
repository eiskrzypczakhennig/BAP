# Errata

[REPORTED] means that I have sent the corresponding errata before receiving the possibility to comment this markdown file to PACKT Customer Care as suggested on page 5 of the book. 

## Chapter 1

page 22:

- "cat or dog" is not the same as "safe and unsafe" (and all the remaining examples in the paragraph). Should it not be  "cat and no cat" or "dog and no dog"?

page 29:

- below figure 1.5: "This represent(s) all the possible values for the bias being equally probable *a priori*."

page 32:

  > "In fact, many result(s) from *frequentist statistics*~~, and~~ can be seen as special cases of a Bayesian model under certain circumstances, such as flat priors."

  > "One common *frequentist* method to estimate parameters is known as maximum likelihood; this method~~s~~ avoids setting *a prior(i)* and ~~works just by finding~~ finds the value of $\theta$ ~~that~~ by maximiz~~es~~(ing) the likelihood."


## Chapter 2

page 50:

- As we can see, the result looks somewhat similar for lossf_a is $\hat \theta = 0.32$

page 57: 

- below table: "Now that we have computed the posterior, we can use it to simulate data and check how consistent the simulated ~~is data~~ data is with respect to the observed data."

page 59: 

- second paragraph: "I(t')s the theoretical distribution [...]"
- last paragraph, third sentence: replace "for $\nu > 2$" with "for $\nu <= 2$" 

page 60: <- perhaps the same as mentioned here for page 59?

- Student's t-distribution: "Is the theoretical distribution itself the one without a defined mean" sounds like a question. May I suggest something like "It is the theoretical distribution itself that is without a defined mean."
- [REPORTED] Student's t-distribution: There seems to be a contradiction in the last paragraph.
     First sentence:
  	> In a similar fashion, **the variance of this distribution is only defined for values of $\nu > 2$**.
     Third sentence of the same paragraph:
  	> **For $\nu > 2$, the distribution has no defined variance** and hence no defined standard deviation.

     In both sentences we have information about the variance when $\nu > 2$, but under this condition the variance is defined in the first sentence, while it is not defined in the second sentence.

page 62: 

- below figure 2.13 the author talks about the parametrization of the exponential with the mean. Unfortunately, the symbol for mean is often $\mu$, which is not occurring in the prior of the exponential distribution in the code.

page 63:

- second paragraph: "how a few of the predictive samples look[s] very flat." 

page 64:

- first paragraph: "to the value[s] estimated"

page 65:

- second paragraph: "help their kids grow[n] stronger"

page 66: 

- the pooled standard deviation should have a plus (+) instead of a minus (-) sign between the group standard deviations. That is: 
     $$\frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{\sqrt{\frac{{\sigma_2}^2 + {\sigma_1}^2}{2}}}$$

page 67:

- second section: "Re-scaling (standardizing) the differences helps us make sense of the importance of the ~~different~~ difference between groups, even when we are not very familiar with the scale used for the measurements."

page 68: 

[REPORTED]: the URL is **https://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/**.

page 73: <- it's page 74 in the PACKT book!

- first paragraph: "i(t')s also possible"

page 76:

I do not understand the meaning of "direct route" in the second paragraph.

page 83:

- first paragraph: "And that is, ladies, gentlem[a](e)n"

## Chapter 3

page 95:

- first paragraph: "this constrain(t) is relaxed"

page 99:

Last sentence of first paragraph says 
     > "..., we can use semitransparent lines that have been sampled from the posterior:..." 
     Well, I assume we do not sample the lines but the posteriors to draw the lines. If this is the case, perhaps the sentence could be changed to something like 
     > "...., we can use the sampled posteriors to draw semitransparent lines."

page 100:

- second to last paragraph: "interval [-1, 1][. It does not matter about](, regardless of) the scale of the data."
- last paragraph: "how much y change(s)"

page 109:

- code block, 4th and 3rd line from bottom: f-strings missing the "f".

page 110:

- figure: there is nonetheless a considerable discrepancy between the dashed line and the continuous line in the range [6,9.5]. Is this a sign of a *good match* as mentioned in the first sentence of the following page?

page 115:

- [REPORTED], code: Should the coefficient of $\alpha_\sigma$ in the deterministic part not be $\beta_\sigma$? 
- [REPORTED], name: I guess the name of the hierarchical model in the text should be `hierarchical_model` and not `hierarhical_model`.

page 116:

- first paragraph: "with an[d] increasing amount"
- [REPORTED], name: first sentence again talks about `hierarhical_model`, though there is only a `hierarchical_model` (with `h`)

page 117:

- first paragraph, middle part: "We call a variable independent because its value cannot be predicted by the model; instead, it is an input of the model and the dependent variable is the output." Can the word *instead* be removed? To me, this word implies a comparison, which is perhaps not intended or required in the sentence.

page 118: 

"We can have one with regular air (that contains -0.04% of CO$_2$) and the others with ~~and~~ an increasing amount of CO$_2$.

page 119:

- second paragraph: "They are just (k)nobs"

page 120:

- first paragraph: "Well that's the subject of Chapter [6] (5), Model Comparison"

page 121: -> first errata on page 123 in book!

- Here, $\beta$ is a  vector of coefficients of length $m$, that is, the number of (in)dependent variables.
- Of course, the parabola is a sub-model of the cubic one when $\beta$ (is zero).

page 122:

- "While it may seem that the previous sample experiment validates the idea of building an infinite order polynomial to ~~the~~ fit (the) data, we should curb our enthusiasm."
- "Part of the job, when analyzing data, is to be sure that models are not overfitting ~~it~~."

page 128:

- first paragraph: "Using a fo(rest plot)"

page 130: 

- [REPORTED], results and text: The text below figure 3.22 does not match with the corresponding figure. For example, already in the first sentence of the paragraph below figure 3.22 the author says that $\beta_2$ is around zero for model `m_x1x2`, but in the graph the coefficient is around -1.0. Also, $\beta_2$ for model `m_x2` is around 0.25 in the figure, but the text says that it is around 0.55.

page 133:

- Figure 3.26 have been updated

page 135: -> on page 137 in book!

- In all of the examples we have seen so far, the (in)dependent variables contribute additively to the predicted variable.

page 136:

- For those cases, we may want to consider the variance as a (linear) function of the (in)dependent variable.

page 138: 

- "The **World Health Organization (WHO)** and other health institutions around the world collect data for newborns and toddlers and design growth charts ~~standards~~." I guess that the word *standards* is not really necessary here or the word *charts* can be removed instead.

page 141:

- question 6: "ArviZ functions like plot_trace and plot_pair"

page 142:

- [REPORTED], in the Summary paragraph: "From a probabilistic perspective, a linear regression model is an extension of the Gaussian model where the mean is not directly estimated but rather computed as a linear function of a predictor variable and some additional parameters." Does the author mean *predicted variable* and **not** *predictor variable* (see page 90 for definitions)?
